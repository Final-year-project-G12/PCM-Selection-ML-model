# Objective 1 — Recommendation Cards (Tamil Nadu)

Generated from 3 climate regimes (GMM clustering, 133 population points).

**Physics validation summary (Phase 7):** mean Spearman rho across clusters = 0.169 (MCDM consensus rank vs. simulated annual solar fraction, grey-box lumped-enthalpy tank model driven by each cluster's medoid point's real 10-year daily climate data). See `10_physics_validation.py`'s docstring for the full stated assumption list (tank size, collector efficiency, draw schedule) before quoting this number without qualification.

**Caveats:** thermal conductivity / density / specific heat not reported in the source data for the literature-added candidates (see 06_build_pcm_database.py); Phase 7's tank/collector parameters are stated assumptions, not measurements (see 10_physics_validation.py's docstring).
